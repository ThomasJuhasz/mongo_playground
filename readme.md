# Mongodb playground

Just a playground project to learn more about mongodb. I created this while watching this udemy tutorial:  
https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-developers-guide-to-mongodb/learn/v4/overview  
With a little difference - I used jasmine tests instead of mocha and async/await syntax instead of promises.

## Prerequisites

1.  Node
2.  mongodb served on localhost:27017

## Running the code

```bash
npm i
npm run test
```

Don't forget to start your mongo service!

```bash
C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.6\bin\mongod.exe
```
